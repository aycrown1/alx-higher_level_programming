# alx-higher_level_programming

Higher-level programming refers to programming languages and paradigms that abstract away many of the low-level details of computer systems, making it easier for developers to write code and focus on solving problems rather than dealing with low-level implementation details.

In higher-level programming, languages are designed to provide a higher level of abstraction, meaning they offer built-in functionality and constructs that simplify common tasks. These languages often have more expressive syntax, extensive libraries, and advanced features that allow programmers to write code in a more concise and human-readable manner.

Some examples of higher-level programming languages include Python, Java, C#, Ruby, and JavaScript. These languages typically offer features like automatic memory management (garbage collection), object-oriented programming (OOP) support, extensive standard libraries, and higher-level constructs such as iterators, generators, and lambda functions.

Higher-level programming languages allow developers to focus on the problem at hand rather than the intricate details of memory management, hardware interaction, or low-level algorithms. They provide abstractions and tools that simplify the development process, making it easier to write and maintain code. However, higher-level languages may sacrifice some performance or control compared to lower-level languages like C or assembly, which provide more direct access to hardware and memory.

Overall, higher-level programming languages are well-suited for tasks that prioritize productivity, readability, and maintainability, while lower-level languages are often used when performance or low-level control is critical.

### Higher Level Programming Languages

##### PYTHON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

Python is considered a higher-level programming language due to its emphasis on simplicity, readability, and expressiveness. Here are some key aspects that contribute to Python's higher-level nature:

- It prioritizes simplicity, readability, and expressiveness.
- Python's syntax is clear and straightforward, enhancing code readability.
- Abstractions like built-in data structures simplify complex tasks.
- Automatic memory management (garbage collection) reduces memory-related errors.
- The extensive standard library provides pre-built functionality for various purposes.
- Dynamic typing enables rapid prototyping and interactive programming.
- High-level constructs like list comprehensions and iterators simplify code expression.
- Python combines high-level convenience with access to lower-level functionality.
- It is widely used for web development, data analysis, and scientific computing.

#### The Origin and about the language

1. Origin of the Name 'Python':
The name 'Python' for the programming language was inspired by the British comedy group Monty Python. Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python, was a fan of the group and decided to name the language after them. It reflects the language's aim to be fun, quirky, and easy to understand.

2. Using the Python Interpreter:
To use the Python interpreter, follow these steps:
- Install Python on your computer by downloading it from the official Python website (python.org) and following the installation instructions for your operating system.
- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Type `python` or `python3` (depending on your installation) and press Enter. This will launch the Python interpreter.
- You can now enter Python code directly into the interpreter prompt and see the results immediately. For example, you can type `print("Hello, World!")` and press Enter to see the output.

3. Official Python Coding Style (PEP 8):
The official Python coding style guide is outlined in Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) 8. It provides guidelines for writing Python code that is consistent, readable, and maintainable. Some key recommendations from PEP 8 include:
- Indentation: Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
- Line Length: Limit lines to 79 characters for better readability.
- Naming Conventions: Use lowercase with underscores for variable and function names, and use uppercase for constants.
- Imports: Import individual modules rather than using wildcard imports.
- Comments: Use comments to explain code when necessary, but write self-explanatory code whenever possible.

4. Checking Code with pycodestyle (formerly pep8):
pycodestyle (formerly known as pep8) is a tool that checks Python code against the PEP 8 coding style guidelines. Here's how to use it:
- Install pycodestyle by running `pip install pycodestyle` in your terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory containing your Python code.
- Run `pycodestyle your_file.py` to check a specific file or `pycodestyle .` to check all Python files in the current directory.
- pycodestyle will display any style violations it finds, indicating the line numbers and specific style recommendations.
- Make the necessary changes to your code to adhere to the PEP 8 guidelines.

Using pycodestyle can help ensure consistency and adherence to the recommended coding style, making your code more readable and maintainable.

#### Creating a Python executable Script

To create a Python executable script, you can follow these steps:

Step 1: Write your Python Script
Create a new file and write your Python script using a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE). Make sure your script has the `.py` extension, which indicates that it is a Python script.

For example, let's create a simple script called `hello.py` that prints "Hello, World!":

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Step 2: Add Shebang Line (Optional)
At the beginning of your Python script, you can optionally include a shebang line. This line specifies the interpreter to use when executing the script. Although it's not strictly necessary, it can be useful, especially on Unix-like systems.

For example, if you are using the Python 3 interpreter, you can add the following shebang line to the top of your script:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
```

Step 3: Make the Script Executable (Unix-like systems)
On Unix-like systems (e.g., Linux or macOS), you need to make the script executable. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where your script is located. Then, run the following command:

```bash
chmod +x your_script.py
```

This command grants execute permissions to the script.

Step 4: Run the Executable Script
Once your script is executable, you can run it directly from the terminal by typing the script's name:

```bash
./your_script.py
```

The script will be executed, and the output (if any) will be displayed in the terminal.

Note: On Windows, Python scripts typically have the `.py` extension associated with the Python interpreter. So, you can run the script by simply typing its name in the command prompt without any additional steps.

By following these steps, you can create a Python executable script that can be executed directly without explicitly invoking the Python interpreter.
