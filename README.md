## HIGHER LEVEL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE 

Higher-level programming refers to programming languages and paradigms that abstract away many of the low-level details of computer systems, making it easier for developers to write code and focus on solving problems rather than dealing with low-level implementation details.

In higher-level programming, languages are designed to provide a higher level of abstraction, meaning they offer built-in functionality and constructs that simplify common tasks. These languages often have more expressive syntax, extensive libraries, and advanced features that allow programmers to write code in a more concise and human-readable manner.

Some examples of higher-level programming languages include Python, Java, C#, Ruby, and JavaScript. These languages typically offer features like automatic memory management (garbage collection), object-oriented programming (OOP) support, extensive standard libraries, and higher-level constructs such as iterators, generators, and lambda functions.

Higher-level programming languages allow developers to focus on the problem at hand rather than the intricate details of memory management, hardware interaction, or low-level algorithms. They provide abstractions and tools that simplify the development process, making it easier to write and maintain code. However, higher-level languages may sacrifice some performance or control compared to lower-level languages like C or assembly, which provide more direct access to hardware and memory.

Overall, higher-level programming languages are well-suited for tasks that prioritize productivity, readability, and maintainability, while lower-level languages are often used when performance or low-level control is critical.

### Higher Level Programming Languages

#### PYTHON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

Python is considered a higher-level programming language due to its emphasis on simplicity, readability, and expressiveness. The name 'Python' for the programming language was inspired by the British comedy group Monty Python. Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python, was a fan of the group and decided to name the language after them. It reflects the language's aim to be fun, quirky, and easy to understand. 

To use the Python interpreter, follow these steps:
- Install Python on your computer by downloading it from the official Python website (python.org) and following the installation instructions for your operating system.
- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Type `python` or `python3` (depending on your installation) and press Enter. This will launch the Python interpreter.
- You can now enter Python code directly into the interpreter prompt and see the results immediately. For example, you can type `print("Hello, World!")` and press Enter to see the output.
On Ubuntu Linux:
```bash
python3 --version # Check Current Python Version
sudo apt update # Update Package Lists
sudo apt install python3 # Install Python 3: If Python 3 is not already installed
python3 --version # Verify Installation
sudo apt install python3-pip # Install pip (Python Package Installer)
pip3 install --upgrade pip # Upgrade pip
sudo apt install python3-venv # Install venv (Virtual Environment): venv is a tool used to create isolated Python environments.
python3 -m venv myenv # Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
source myenv/bin/activate # To activate the virtual environment

```

- Here are some key aspects that contribute to Python's higher-level nature:

- It prioritizes simplicity, readability, and expressiveness.
- Python's syntax is clear and straightforward, enhancing code readability.
- Abstractions like built-in data structures simplify complex tasks.
- Automatic memory management (garbage collection) reduces memory-related errors.
- The extensive standard library provides pre-built functionality for various purposes.
- Dynamic typing enables rapid prototyping and interactive programming.
- High-level constructs like list comprehensions and iterators simplify code expression.
- Python combines high-level convenience with access to lower-level functionality.
- It is widely used for web development, data analysis, and scientific computing




#### STRUCTURE QUERY LANGUAGE (SQL):

SQL stands for Structured Query Language, which is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating relational databases.MySQL is an open-source relational database management system that uses SQL to manage and interact with databases.To create a database in MySQL, you use the CREATE DATABASE statement: CREATE DATABASE database_name;DDL stands for Data Definition Language, used for creating and modifying database structures. DML stands for Data Manipulation Language, used for querying and modifying data within the database.
SQL is often considered a higher-level programming language due to its abstraction from the underlying details of the database management system (DBMS) and its focus on declarative rather than procedural logic.

To use SQL, you need to install it in your computer, here is how:

```bash
sudo apt update # Update Package List
sudo apt install mysql-server # Install MySQL Server

sudo service mysql start # Start MySQL Service
sudo mysql_secure_installation # Secure MySQL Installation
mysql -u root -p # Access MySQL

```

Here are a few reasons why SQL is considered a higher-level programming language:
- Declarative Syntax: SQL queries are written in a declarative syntax, where you describe what data you want to retrieve or manipulate, rather than specifying the steps or processes to achieve it.
- Abstraction from Implementation: SQL abstracts the complexities of how data is stored, accessed, and manipulated in the database.
- Optimization by the DBMS: When you write SQL queries, you don't need to optimize the execution path or access methods.
- Data-Centric Approach: SQL is designed for managing and querying structured data.
- Set-Based Operations: SQL operates on sets of data, allowing you to perform operations on multiple rows of data at once. 
- Standardization: SQL is an industry-standard language for relational databases.
- Readability: SQL queries can be more readable and concise compared to writing equivalent logic in low-level languages.
- Focus on Data Manipulation: SQL's primary purpose is working with data stored in databases.
